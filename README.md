# Indian-Crop-Analysis
Data Analysis done with Python for Indian Crop, data received from kaggle.

Hi All, Welcome to my first code uploaded on Github. In this code I have done a basic analysis of Indian Crops. The data is downloaded from Kaggle.

In this code, first I have imported Pandas library. It is very extensively used for data ingestion from different file formats and even from databases.
